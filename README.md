 # SwiftCart Regional Sales Analysis

 ## Project Overview

This project analyzes SwiftCart’s regional sales performance to understand patterns, key trends, and opportunities for improvement. The analysis was performed using Python in Jupyter Notebook with a focus on sales, revenue, and regional comparisons.

The goal is to help stakeholders quickly identify which regions drive the most sales, where the company is underperforming, and what strategies could maximize overall growth.

## What’s Inside

-> Data Cleaning & Preparation → handled missing values, standardized formats.

-> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) → visualized sales by region, product category, and time.

-> Revenue Insights → highlighted top-performing regions and products.

-> Comparative Analysis → compared sales across regions to identify strengths and weaknesses.

-> Actionable Recommendations → suggested steps to improve sales performance.

## Tools & Libraries Used

-> Python (Pandas, NumPy) → data manipulation

-> Matplotlib / Seaborn → data visualization

-> Jupyter Notebook → analysis and presentation

## Key Findings
